                                             <h2>The Shooting Of Dan McGrew</h2>
                                             <h3>           A bunch of boys were whooping it up at the  Malamute Saloon.
                                                            The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;
                                                            Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,
                                                            And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as Lou.
                                                            
                                                            When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and the glare,
                                                            There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for bear.
                                                            He looked like a man with a foot in the grave and scarcely the strength of a louse,
                                                            Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for drinks for the house.
                                                            There was none could place the stranger's face, though we searched ourselves for a clue;
                                                            But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew.
                                                            
                                                            There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them hard like a spell;
                                                            And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;
                                                            With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,
                                                            As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one by one.
                                                            Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do,
                                                            And I turned my head — and there watching him was the lady that's known as Lou.
                                                            
                                                            His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of daze,
                                                            Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze.
                                                            The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the stool,
                                                            So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like a fool.
                                                            In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;
                                                            Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands — my God! but that man could play.
                                                            Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear,
                                                            And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could hear;
                                                            With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold,
                                                            A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck called gold;
                                                            While high overhead, green, yellow and red, the North Lights swept in bars? —
                                                            Then you've a hunch what the music meant. . . hunger and night and the stars.
                                                            
                                                            And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans,
                                                            But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;
                                                            For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof above;
                                                            But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love —
                                                            A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true —
                                                            (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge, — the lady that's known as Lou.)
